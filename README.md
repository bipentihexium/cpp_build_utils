- [C++ build utils](#c-build-utils)
	- [Installation / Usage](#installation--usage)
	- [cproxy](#cproxy)
	- [cmake_gen](#cmake_gen)

## Installation / Usage

The recommended way to install tthis is to add this directory to yout PATH :), then access all features through `cproxy.sh` or `cproxy.bat`.

## cproxy

It's a binding from one command to multiple tools. I tried to make it seem a bit like rust's cargo :) .

## cmake_gen

A generator of cmake files from json, to make cmake more approachable to beginners.
